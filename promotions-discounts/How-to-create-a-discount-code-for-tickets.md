## Step 6: Fill in your details
Give your discount code a name (For example: FOSSASIA, and please note that the code should be in uppercase format with no space in between)

You can provide the amount of discount by providing either `amount` or `percent`. 

For `amount`, Eventyay currently offers Singaporean Dollars only, if you use a different currency for your event, please select ` percent` instead. 

For a discount code to be valid, its `status` should be `active`. 

You can select the tickets that can be used with the discount code for `all ticket types` or `standard community` only.

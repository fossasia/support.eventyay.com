title: Do I need to print my tickets for in person events
---

Both hard copy and electronic tickets are acceptable in mose cases, unless special instruction was given by the event organizer specifically. If not, you can either:

#### Print a hard copy of your tickets and present it at the event's registration point to check in.

*or*

#### Show your tickets in the Eventyay app on your mobile device or take a screenshot of the tickets and bring them along.

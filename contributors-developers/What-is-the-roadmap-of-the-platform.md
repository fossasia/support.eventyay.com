# What is the roadmap of the platform?

Our goal is to offer the world's best event platform using Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). Our roadmap to achieve this depends on a number of factors. These include user feedback and available resources.

Due to the current situation where many events are held online we focus on developing online event features such as integration with video tools and streaming platforms.

# Who develops eventyay?

[eventyay.com](https://eventyay.com) is the hosted service of the [Open Event](https://github.com/fossasia?q=open-event) application developed by [FOSSASIA](https://fossasia.org) in cooperation with a global community. 

The project started 2015 and was used for many years as an event management system for the annual [FOSSASIA Summit](https://summit.fossasia.org), OpenTechSummits and meetups. Since 2019 the platform can be used as a hosted solution by event organizers.

Most of the code contributions have been done by hundreds of community developers, but FOSSASIA also employs a team of developers who maintain the system, review pull requests and define the roadmap of the project. 

There are a number of repositories ranging from the frontend, to backend, Android apps for attendees and organizers as well as iOS apps (attendee/organizers). 

To learn more about developers you can always visit the tab “insights” on one of the repositories and choose “contributors” on the menu tab, e.g on the [frontend repo](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-frontend/graphs/contributors) or the [server repository](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-server/graphs/contributors).

# How can I set up the system myself?

In order to set up the [Open Event software suite](https://github.com/fossasia?q=open-event) that is powering [eventyay.com](https://eventyay.com) yourself, you need to have a server and knowledge of commandline.

There are installation instructions in the repositories of the [Open Event Frontend](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-frontend/) and the [Open Event Server](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-server/).

Check out this article to learn [how to set up your tickets](http://support.eventyay.com/tickets-payments/How-do-I-sell-tickets-online.html). 

Once you have done the first step, scroll down to **Choose payment methods** and tick on `YES, accept payment at the event (on site)` under **Offline Payments**.

# How to sell tickets on eventyay?

In the article [How can I create an event](/event-setup/How-can-I-create-an-event.md), we have learned that we need to add at least one ticket type to publish the event on [eventyay.com](eventyay.com). 
In this article, we'll go into details how we can add and sell tickets.

Here you can add a description to your ticket, set its `start` and `end` time, and control whether you want to publish or hide this on the public events page. You can also limit the number of tickets for each order. 

## Adding a Paid Ticket type 
Firstly, we need to give it a name, define its price, quantity, and set up payment details (country and currency).

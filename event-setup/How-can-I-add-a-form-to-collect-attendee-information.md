# How can I add a form to collect attendee information?

You need to create an event before you can set up the `Attendee Form`. To learn how to create an event, check out [How can I create an event on Eventyay](../event-setup/How-can-I-create-an-event.md). Once you have created your event, follow these steps to add and configure the `Attendee Form`. 

1. Log in to your acocunt on **Eventyay**.

5. Turn on `Attendee Form` to collect attendees' information.

6. Once `Attendee Form` has been turned on, you will see two other tables as below:

- **Information to Collect**: A list of additional questions provided by **Eventyay** for you to choose from. If you want to include any of these questions, slide the controller in front of each question to `Include` or `Require`.  

- **Add Custom Form Field**: This feature allows you to add in any other questions to collect more answers/information from your attendees.

**Notice**: If you want to use the `Custom Form Field`, simply input the question into `Field Name` and select the type of information you want to collect (`Text` or `Number`) from the dropdown menu.

After you finish, select `Save Draft` to save your changes or publish your changes right away using the `Publish` button. You can also preview your changes in draft stage. Simply click **Preview** and see how your event would look like on the public event page once published.
